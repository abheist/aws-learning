- Traditional Architecture
	  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 7.38.29 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%207.38.29%20PM.png)
	- Traditional applications leverage RDBMS databases  
	- These databases have the SQL query language  
	- Strong requirements about how the data should be modeled  
	- Ability to do query joins, aggregations, complex computations  
	- Vertical scaling (getting a more powerful CPU / RAM / IO)  
	- Horizontal scaling (increasing reading capability by adding EC2 / RDS Read Replicas)
- NoSQL databases
	- NoSQL databases are non-relational databases and are distributed 
	- NoSQL databases include MongoDB, DynamoDB, ...
	- NoSQL databases do not support query joins (or just limited support)
	- All the data that is needed for a query is present in one row
	- NoSQL databases don’t perform aggregations such as “SUM”, “AVG”, ...
	- NoSQL databases scale horizontally
	- There’s no “right or wrong” for NoSQL vs SQL, they just require to model the data differently and think about user queries differently
- Amazon DynamoDB
	- Fully managed, highly available with replication across multiple AZs  
	- NoSQL database - not a relational database  
	- Scales to massive workloads, distributed database  
	- Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
	- Fast and consistent in performance (low latency on retrieval)
	- Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
	- Enables event driven programming with DynamoDB Streams  
	- Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities  
	- Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class
- Basics
	- DynamoDB is made of Tables
	- Each table has a Primary Key (must be decided at creation time)
	- Each table can have an infinite number of items (= rows)
	- Each item has attributes (can be added over time – can be null)
	- Maximum size of an item is 400KB
	- Data types supported are:
		- Scalar Types – String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
		- Document Types – List, Map
		- Set Types – String Set, Number Set, Binary Set
- Primary Keys
	- Option 1: Partition Key (HASH)
		- Partition key must be unique for each item
		- Partition key must be “diverse” so that the data is distributed
		- Example:“User_ID” for a users table
			  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 7.42.19 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%207.42.19%20PM.png)
	- Option 2: Partition Key + Sort Key (HASH + RANGE)
		- The combination must be unique for each item
		- Data is grouped by partition key
		- Example: users-games table,“User_ID” for Partition Key and “Game_ID” for Sort Key
			  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 7.43.08 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%207.43.08%20PM.png)
- Partition Keys
	- We’re building a movie database
	- What is the best Partition Key to maximize data distribution?
		- movie_id
		- producer_name
		- leader_actor_name • movie_language
	- “movie_id” has the highest cardinality so it’s a good candidate
	- “movie_language” doesn’t take many values and may be skewed towards English so it’s not a great choice for the Partition Key
- Read/Write Capacity Modes
	- Control how you manage your table’s capacity (read/write throughput)
	- Provisioned Mode (default)
		- You specify the number of reads/writes per second
		- You need to plan capacity beforehand
		- Pay for provisioned read & write capacity units
		- Table must have provisioned read and write capacity units
		- Read Capacity Units (RCU) – throughput for reads
		- Write Capacity Units (WCU) – throughput for writes
		- Option to setup auto-scaling of throughput to meet demand
		- Throughput can be exceeded temporarily using “Burst Capacity”
		- If Burst Capacity has been consumed, you’ll get a “ProvisionedThroughputExceededException”
		- It’s then advised to do an exponential backoff retry
	- On-Demand Mode
		- Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads
		- No capacity planning needed
		- Pay for what you use, more expensive ($\$\$)
		- Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads  
		- No capacity planning needed (WCU / RCU)  
		- Unlimited WCU & RCU, no throttle, more expensive  
		- You’re charged for reads/writes that you use in terms of RRU and WRU
		- Read Request Units (RRU) – throughput for reads (same as RCU)
		- Write Request Units (WRU) – throughput for writes (same as WCU)
		- 2.5x more expensive than provisioned capacity (use with care)  
		- Use cases: unknown workloads, unpredictable application traffic, ...
	- You can switch between different modes once every 24 hours
- Write Capacity Units (WCU)
	- One Write Capacity Unit (WCU) represents one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size 
	- If the items are larger than 1 KB, more WCUs are consumed
	- Example 1: 
		- we write 10 items per second, with item size 2 KB
		- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 7.49.48 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%207.49.48%20PM.png)
	- Example 2: 
		- we write 6 items per second, with item size 4.5 KB
		- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 7.50.09 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%207.50.09%20PM.png)
	- Example 3: 
		- we write 120 items per minute, with item size 2 KB
		- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 7.50.27 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%207.50.27%20PM.png)
- Strongly Consistent Read  vs. Eventually Consistent Read
	- Eventually Consistent Read (default)
		- If we read just after a write, it’s possible we’ll get some stale data because of replication
	- Strongly Consistent Read
		- If we read just after a write, we will get the correct data
		- Set “ConsistentRead” parameter to True in API calls (GetItem, BatchGetItem, Query, Scan)
		- Consumes twice the RCU
			  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 8.48.06 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%208.48.06%20PM.png)
- Read Capacity Units (RCU)
	- One Read Capacity Unit (RCU) represents one Strongly Consistent Read per second, or two Eventually Consistent Reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size
	- If the items are larger than 4 KB, more RCUs are consumed
	- Example 1: 10 Strongly Consistent Reads per second, with item size 4 KB
	- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 8.49.34 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%208.49.34%20PM.png)
	- Example 2: 16 Eventually Consistent Reads per second, with item size 12 KB
	- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 8.49.44 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%208.49.44%20PM.png)
	- Example 3: 10 Strongly Consistent Reads per second, with item size 6 KB
	- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 8.49.50 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%208.49.50%20PM.png)
- Partition Internal
	- Data is stored in partitions
	- Partition Keys go through a hashing algorithm to know to which partition they go to
	- To compute the number of partitions:![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 8.51.34 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%208.51.34%20PM.png)
	- WCUs and RCUs are spread evenly across partitions![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 8.51.44 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%208.51.44%20PM.png)
- Throttling
	- If we exceed provisioned RCUs or WCUs, we get `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`
	- Reasons:
		- Hot Keys – one partition key is being read too many times (e.g., popular item)
		- Hot Partitions
		- Very large items, remember RCU and WCU depends on size of items
	- Solutions:
		- Exponential backoff when exception is encountered (already in SDK)
		- Distribute partition keys as much as possible
		- If RCU issue, we can use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
- Writing Data
	- PutItem
		- Creates a new item or fully replace an old item (same Primary Key)
		- ConsumesWCUs
	- UpdateItem
		- Edits an existing item’s attributes or adds a new item if it doesn’t exist
		- Can be used to implement Atomic Counters – a numeric attribute that’s unconditionally incremented
	- Conditional Writes
		- Accept a write/update/delete only if conditions are met, otherwise returns an error
		- Helps with concurrent access to items
		- No performance impact
- Reading Data
	- GetItem
		- Read based on Primary key
		- Primary Key can be HASH or HASH+RANGE
		- Eventually Consistent Read (default)
		- Option to use Strongly Consistent Reads (more RCU - might take longer)
		- ProjectionExpression can be specified to retrieve only certain attributes
	- Query
		- Query returns items based on:
		- KeyConditionExpression
			- Partition Key value (must be = operator) – required  
			- SortKeyvalue(=,<,<=,>,>=,Between,Beginswith)–optional
		- FilterExpression
			- Additional filtering after the Query operation (before data returned to you)
			- Use only with non-key attributes (does not allow HASH or RANGE attributes
		- Returns:
			- The number of items specified in Limit
			- Orupto1MBofdata
		- Ability to do pagination on the results
		- Can query table, a Local Secondary Index, or a Global Secondary Index
	- Scan
		- Scan the entire table and then filter out data (inefficient)
		- Returns up to 1 MB of data – use pagination to keep on reading
		- Consumes a lot of RCU
		- Limit impact using Limit or reduce the size of the result and pause
		- For faster performance, use Parallel Scan
			- Multiple workers scan multiple data segments at the same time
			- Increases the throughput and RCU consumed
			- Limit the impact of parallel scans just like you would for Scans
		- Can use ProjectionExpression & FilterExpression (no changes to RCU)
- Deleting Data
	- DeleteItem
		- Delete an individual item
		- Ability to perform a conditional delete
	- DeleteTable
		- Delete a whole table and all its items
		- Much quicker deletion than calling DeleteItem on all items
- Batch Operations
	- Allows you to save in latency by reducing the number of API calls
	- Operations are done in parallel for better efficiency
	- Part of a batch can fail; in which case we need to try again for the failed items
	- BatchWriteItem
		- Up to 25 PutItem and/or DeleteItem in one call
		- Up to 16 MB of data written,up to 400 KB of data per item
		- Can’t update items (use UpdateItem)
		- `UnprocessedItems` for failed write operations (exponential backoff or add WCU)
	- BatchGetItem
		- Return items from one or more tables
		- Up to 100 items, up to 16 MB of data
		- Items are retrieved in parallel to minimize latency
		- `UnprocessedKeys` for failed read operations (exponential backoff or add RCU)
- PartiQL
	- SQL-compatible query language for DynamoDB
	- Allows you to select, insert, update, and delete data in DynamoDB using SQL
	- Run queries across multiple DynamoDB tables
	- Run PartiQL queries from:
		- AWS Management Console
		- NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB
		- DynamoDB APIs
		- AWS CLI
		- AWS SDK
	```sql
	SELECT OrderID, Total
	FROM Orders
	Where OrderID IN [1, 2, 3]
	ORDER By OrderID DESC
	```
	- Use a SQL-like syntax to manipulate DynamoDB tables
	- Supports some (but not all) statements
		- INSERT
		- UPDATE
		- SELECT
		- DELETE
	- It supports batch operations
- Conditional Write
	- For PutItem, UpdateItem, DeleteItem, and BatchWriteItem
	- You can specify a Condition expression to determine which items should be modified:
		- attribute_exists
		- attribute_not_exists
		- attribute_type
		- contains (for string)
		- begins_with (for string)
		- ProductCategory IN (:cat1, :cat2) and Price between :low and :high
		- size (string length)
	- Note: Filter Expression filters the results of read queries, while Condition Expressions are for write operations
	- Example on update item
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 9.55.10 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%209.55.10%20PM.png)
	- Example on Delete Item
		- attribute_not_exists
			- Only succeeds if the attribute doesn't exist yet (no value)
				  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 9.57.48 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%209.57.48%20PM.png)
		- attribute_exists
			- Opposite of attribute_not_exists
				  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 9.58.00 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%209.58.00%20PM.png)
	- Do not Overwrite Elements
		- attribute_not_exists(partition_key)
			- Make sure the item isn’t overwritten
		- attribute_not_exists(partition_key) and attribute_not_exists(sort_key)
			- Make sure the partition / sort key combination is not overwritten
	- Example Complex Condition
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 9.58.57 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%209.58.57%20PM.png)
	- Example of String comparisons
		- begins_with - check if prefix matches
		- contains - check if string is contained in another string
			  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 9.59.46 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%209.59.46%20PM.png)
- Local Secondary Index (LSI)
	- Alternative Sort Key for your table (same Partition Key as that of base table) 
	- The Sort Key consists of one scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
	- Up to 5 Local Secondary Indexes per table
	- Must be defined at table creation time
	- Attribute Projections – can contain some or all the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.00.30 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.00.30%20PM.png)
- Global Secondary Index (GSI)
	- Alternative Primary Key (HASH or HASH+RANGE) from the base table
	- Speed up queries on non-key attributes
	- The Index Key consists of scalar attributes (String, Number, or Binary)
	- Attribute Projections – some or all the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
	- Must provision RCUs & WCUs for the index
	- Can be added/modified after table creation
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.01.30 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.01.30%20PM.png)
- Indexes and Throttling
	- Global Secondary Index (GSI):
		- If the writes are throttled on the GSI, then the main table will be throttled!
		- Even if the WCU on the main tables are fine
		- Choose your GSI partition key carefully!
		- Assign your WCU capacity carefully!
	- Local Secondary Index (LSI):
		- Uses the WCUs and RCUs of the main table
		- No special throttling considerations
- Optimistic Locking
	- DynamoDB has a feature called “Conditional Writes”
	- A strategy to ensure an item hasn’t changed before you update/delete it
	- Each item has an attribute that acts as a version number
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.04.16 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.04.16%20PM.png)
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
	- Fully-managed, highly available, seamless in-memory cache for DynamoDB
	- Microseconds latency for cached reads & queries
	- Doesn’t require application logic modification (compatible with existing DynamoDB APIs)
	- Solves the “Hot Key” problem (too many reads)
	- 5 minutes TTL for cache (default)
	- Up to 10 nodes in the cluster
	- Multi-AZ (3 nodes minimum recommended for production)
	- Secure (Encryption at rest with KMS,VPC, IAM, CloudTrail, ...)
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.05.29 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.05.29%20PM.png)
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) vs. ElastiCache
	  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.05.50 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.05.50%20PM.png)
- DynamoDB Streams
	- Ordered stream of item-level modifications (create/update/delete) in a table
	- Stream records can be:
		- Sent to Kinesis Data Streams
		- Read by AWS Lambda
		- Read by Kinesis Client Library applications
	- Data Retention for up to 24 hours
	- Use cases:
		- react to changes in real-time (welcome email to users)
		- Analytics
		- Insert into derivative tables
		- Insert into OpenSearch Service
		- Implement cross-region replication
		![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.07.19 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.07.19%20PM.png)
	- Ability to choose the information that will be written to the stream:
		- KEYS_ONLY – only the key attributes of the modified item
		- NEW_IMAGE – the entire item, as it appears after it was modified  
		- OLD_IMAGE – the entire item, as it appeared before it was modified
		- NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES – both the new and the old images of the item
	- DynamoDB Streams are made of shards, just like Kinesis Data Streams
	- You don’t provision shards, this is automated by AWS
	- Records are not retroactively populated in a stream after enabling it
- DynamoDB Streams & AWS Lambda
	- You need to define an Event Source Mapping to read from a DynamoDB Streams
	- You need to ensure the Lambda function has the appropriate permissions
	- Your Lambda function is invoked synchronously
		  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.09.11 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.09.11%20PM.png)
- Time To Live (TTL)
	- Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp
	- Doesn’t consume any WCUs (i.e., no extra cost)
	- The TTL attribute must be a “Number” data type with “Unix Epoch timestamp” value
	- Expired items deleted within 48 hours of expiration
	- Expired items, that haven’t been deleted, appears in reads/queries/scans (if you don’t want them, filter them out)
	- Expired items are deleted from both LSIs and GSIs
	- A delete operation for each expired item enters the DynamoDB Streams (can help recover expired items)
	- Use cases: reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations, ...![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.10.24 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.10.24%20PM.png)
- DynamoDB CLI - Good to know
	- --projection-expression: one or more attributes to retrieve 
	- --filter-expression: filter items before returned to you
	- General AWS CLI Pagination options (e.g., DynamoDB, S3, ...)  
		- --page-size: specify that AWS CLI retrieves the full list of items but with a larger number of API calls instead of one API call (default: 1000 items)
		- --max-items: max. number of items to show in the CLI (returns NextToken)
		- --starting-token: specify the last NextToken to retrieve the next set of items
- DynamoDB Transactions
	- Coordinated, all-or-nothing operations (add/update/delete) to multiple items across one or more tables
	- Provides Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID)
	- Read Modes – Eventual Consistency, Strong Consistency, Transactional
	- Write Modes – Standard, Transactional
	- Consumes 2x WCUs & RCUs
		- DynamoDB performs 2 operations for every item (prepare & commit)
	- Two operations:
		- TransactGetItems – one or more GetItem operations
		- TransactWriteItems – one or more PutItem, UpdateItem, and DeleteItem operations
	- Use cases: financial transactions, managing orders, multiplayer games, ...![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.12.28 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.12.28%20PM.png)
	- Capacity Computations
		- Important for the exam!
		- Example1: 3 Transactional writes per second, with item size 5 KB
			- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.13.56 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.13.56%20PM.png)
		- Example 2: 5 Transaction reads per second , with item size 5 KB
			- We need![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.14.07 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.14.07%20PM.png)
			- (5 gets rounded to the upper 4 KB)
- DynamoDB as Session State Cache
	- It’s common to use DynamoDB to store session states
	- vs. ElastiCache
		- ElastiCache is in-memory, but DynamoDB is serverless
		- Both are key/value stores
	- vs. EFS
		- EFS must be attached to EC2 instances as a network drive
	- vs. EBS & Instance Store
		- EBS & Instance Store can only be used for local caching, not shared caching
	- vs. S#
		- S3 is higher latency, and not meant for small objects
- DynamoDB Write Sharding
	- Imagine we have a voting application with two candidates, candidate A and candidate B
	- If Partition Key is “Candidate_ID”, this results into two partitions, which will generate issues (e.g., Hot Partition)
	- A strategy that allows better distribution of items evenly across partitions
	- Add a suffix to Partition Key value
	- Two methods:
		- Sharding Using Random Suffix
		- Sharding Using Calculated Suffix
	  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.16.25 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.16.25%20PM.png)

- DynamoDB Operations
	- Table Cleanup
		- Option 1: Scan + DeleteItem
			- Very slow, consumes RCU & WCU, expensive
		- Option 2: Drop Table + Recreate table
			- Fast, efficient, cheap
	- Copying a DynamoDB Table
		- Option 1: Using AWS Data Pipeline
		- Option 2: Backup and restore into a new table
			- Takes some time
		- Option 3: Scan + PutItem or BatchWriteItem
			- Write your own code![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.20.34 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.20.34%20PM.png)
- Security & Other Features
	- Security
		- VPC Endpoints available to access DynamoDB without using the Internet
		- Access fully controlled by IAM
		- Encryption at rest using AWS KMS and in-transit using SSL/TLS
	- Backup and Restore feature available
		- Point-in-time Recovery (PITR) like RDS
		- No performance impact
	- GlobalTables
		- Multi-region, multi-active, fully replicated, high performance
	- DynamoDB Local
		- Develop and test apps locally without accessing the DynamoDB web service (without Internet)
	- AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) can be used to migrate to DynamoDB (from MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL, S3, ...)
- User Interact with DynamoDB Directly
	  ![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.22.40 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.22.40%20PM.png)
- Fine Grained Access Control
	- Using Web Identity Federation or Cognito Identity Pools, each user gets AWS credentials
	- You can assign an IAM Role to these users with a Condition to limit their API access to DynamoDB
	- LeadingKeys – limit row-level access for users on the Primary Key
	- Attributes – limit specific attributes the user can see![Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 10.23.21 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-07-15%20at%2010.23.21%20PM.png)
