- What is serverless ?
	- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore...
	- They just deploy code
	- They just deploy...functions!
	- Initially...Serverless =\=. FaaS (Function as a Service)
	- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc"
	- Serverless does not mean there are no servers... it means you just don't have to manage, provision, see them.
