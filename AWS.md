## Learning

### [[AWS Infrastructure]]
- [AWS global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)
- [[Regions]]
	- Regions are all around the world
	- Cluster of data-centers
	- Most AWS services are region scoped
	- How to choose AWS regions
		- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements. 
			Data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
		- Proximity to customer.
			Reduced latency
		- Available services within a region.
			new services and new features aren't available in every region
		- Pricing
			Pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
- [[Availability Zones]]
	- Each region has many availability zones
		- usually 3, min is 3, max is 6.
	- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete [[data centers]] with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
	- They are separate from each other, so that they-re isolated from disasters.
	- They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
- [[Data Centers]]
- [[Edge Locations|Point of Presence]]
	- aws has 400+ Point of Presence  (400+ edge locations & 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
	- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
