- We have learned how to:
	- Create AWS resources, manually (fundamentals)
	- Interact with AWS Programmatically (AWS CLI)
	- Deploy code to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk
- All these manual steps make it very likely for us to do mistakes!
- We would like our code "in a repository" and have it deployed onto AWS
	- Automatically
	- The right way
	- Making sure it's tested before being deployed
	- With possibility to go into different stages (dev, test, staging , prod)
	- With manual approval where needed
- To be a proper AWS developer... we need to learn AWS CICD
- This section is all about auto
