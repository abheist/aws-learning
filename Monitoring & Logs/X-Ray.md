- AWS X-Rays
	- Troubleshooting application performance and errors
	- Distributed tracing of micro-services
- Debugging in production, the good old way:
	- Test locally
	- Add log statements everywhere
	- Re-deploy in production
- Log formats differ across applications using CloudWatch and analytics is hard
- Debugging:
	- monolith: easy
	- distributed services: hard
- No common view of your entire architecture
- Enter... AWS X-ray!
- Visual analysis of our applications

- X-Ray advantages
	- Troubleshooting performance (bottleneck)
	- Understand dependencies in microservice architecture
	- Pinpoint service issues
	- Review request behaviour
	- Find errors and exceptions
	- Are we meeting time SLA ?
	- Where I am throttled ?
	- Identify users that are impacted
- X-Ray compatibility
	- AWS Lambda
	- Elastic Beanstalk
	- ECS
	- ELB
	- API Gateway
	- EC2 Instances or any application server (even on premise)
- X-Ray Leverages Tracing
	- Tracing is an end to end way to following a "request"
	- Each component dealing with the request adds its own "trace"
	- Tracing is made of segments (+ sub segments)
	- Annotations can be added to traces to provide extra-information
	- Ability to trace:
		- Every request
		- Sample request (as a % for example or a rate per minute)
	- X-Ray Security:
		- IAM for authorization
		- KMS for encryption at rest
- How to enable X-Ray:
	- Your code (Java, Python, Go, NodeJS, .Net) must import the AWS X-Ray SDK
		- Very little code modification needed
		- The application SDK will then capture
			- Call to AWS services
			- HTTP / HTTPS requests
			- Database calls (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB)
			- Queue calls (SQS)
	- Install the X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS Integration
		- X-Ray daemon works as a low level UDP packet interceptor (Linux / Windows / Mac)
		- AWS Lambda / other AWS services already run the X-Ray daemon for you
		- Each application must have the IAM rights to write data to X-Ray

- X-Ray Magic
	- X-Ray service collects data from all the different services
	- Service map is computed from all the segments and traces
	- X-Ray is graphical, so even non technical people can help troubleshoot
- X-Ray Troubleshooting
	- If X-Ray is not working on EC2
		- Ensure the EC2 IAM Role has the proper permissions
		- Ensure the EC2 instance is running the X-Ray Daemon
	- To enable on AWS Lambda
		- Ensure it has an IAM execution role with proper policy (AWSX-RayWriteOnlyAccess)
		- Ensure that X-Ray is imported in the code
		- Enable Lambda X-Ray Active Tracing
- X-Ray console is under sidebar of CloudWatch console
- X-Instrumentation in your code
	- Instrumentation means the measure of product's performance, diagnose errors, and to write trace information.
	- To instrument your application code, you use the X-Ray SDK
	- Many SDK require only confirmation changes
	- You can modify your application code to customize and annotation the data that the SDK sends to X-Ray using interceptors, filters, handlers, middleware...
- Advanced X-Ray concepts
	- Segments: each application / service will send them
	- Subsegments: if you need more details in your segment
	- Trace: segments collected together to form and end-to-end trace
	- Sampling: decrease the amount of requests sent to X-Ray, reduce cost
	- Annotations: Key Value pair used to index traces and use the filters
	- Metadata: Key value pair, not indexed, not used for searching
	- The X-Ray daemon / agent has a confirm to send traces cross account:
		- Make sure the IAM permissions are correct - the agent will assume the role
		- This allows to have a central account for all your application tracing
- Sampling Rules
	- With sampling rules, you control the amount of data that you record
	- You can modify sampling rules without changing your code
	- By Default, the X-Ray SDK records the ==first request each second==, and ==five percent of any additional request==.
	- One request per second is the reservoir, which ensures that at least one trace is recorded each second as long the service is serving requests.
	- Five percent is the rate at which additional requests beyond the reservoir size are sampled.
- Custom sampling Rules:
	- You can create your own rules with the reservoir and rate
		  ![[Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 6.27.25 AM.png]]
- Sampling rules can defined by going to Settings in sidebar from CloudWatch Console. And in Settings, go to Traces and under traces, there is section of sampling rules.
- X-Ray APIs
	- Write APIs
		- `PutTraceSegments`: Uploads segments documents to AWS X-Ray
		- `PutTelemetryRecords`: Used by the AWS X-Ray daemon to upload telemetry
			- `SegmentsReceivedCount`
			- `SegmentsRejectedCounts`
			- `BackendConnectionErrors`...
		- `GetSamplingRules`: Retrieve all sampling rules (to know what/when to send)
		- `GetSamplingTargets` & `GetSamplingStatisticSummaries` advanced
		- The X-Ray daemon needs to have an IAM policy authorizing the correct API calls to function correctly
	- Read APIs
		- `GetServiceGraph`: man graph
		- `BatchGetTraces`: Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID. Each trace is collection of segment documents that originates from a single request.
		- `GetTraceSummaries`: Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to BatchGetTraces.
		- `GetTraceGraph`: Retrieves a service graph for one or more specific trace IDs.
- X-Ray with Elastic Beanstalk
	- AWS Elastic Beanstalk platform include the X-Ray daemon
	- You can run the daemon by setting an option in the Elastic Beanstalk console or with a configuration file (in `.ebextensions/xray-daemon.config`)
	```yaml
	option_settings:
		aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray:
			XRayEnabled: true
	```
	- Make sure to give your instance profile the correct IAM permissions so that the X-Ray daemon can function correctly
	- Then make sure your application code is instrumented with the X-Ray SDK
	- Note: the X-Ray daemon is not provided for Multi-container Docker
- X-Ray with ECS
