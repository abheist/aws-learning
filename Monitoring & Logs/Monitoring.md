		- Leveraging the best AWS components
	- Our applications are deployed, and our users don't care how we didi it...
	- Our users only care that the application is working
		- Application latency
		- Application outrage
		- Users contacting the IT department or complaining is not a good outcome
		- Troubleshooting and remediation
	- Internal monitoring
		- Can we prevent issues before they happen ?
		- Performance and Cost
