- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability
- High availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
- High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (== Availability Zones)
- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss
- The high availability can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ for example)
- The high availability can be active (for horizontal scaling)

### Example
- Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
