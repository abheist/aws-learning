- Vertically scalability means increasing the size of the instance
- For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
- Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non-distributed systems, such as a database
- RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically.
- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (Hardware limit)

### Example
- Increase instance size (= scale up/down)
- From t2.nano: 0.5GB og RAM, I vCPU
- To u-12tb1.metal - 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
