- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
- Roles are just like users, but they are not intended to be used by real person, and are intended to be used by any other service on your behalf.
- Eg:
	- EC2 instance, may want to perform some actions on aws.
	- To do so, we can create IAM role which can be used by EC2
- Common roles
	- EC2 Instance Roles
	- Lambda Function Roles
	- Roles for CloudFormation
