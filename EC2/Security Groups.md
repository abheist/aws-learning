- Security groups are fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances.![Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 8.51.07 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-06-05%20at%208.51.07%20PM.png)
- Security groups only contains allow rules
- One EC2 instance can have multiple security groups
- Security groups riles can reference by IP or by security group
- Security groups are acting as a "Firewall" on EC2 instances
- They regulate:
	- Access to Ports
	- Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
	- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
	- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)![Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 8.53.53 PM](../images%201/Screenshot%202023-06-05%20at%208.53.53%20PM.png)

	- Good to know
		- They can be attached to multiple instances
		- Locked to to a region / VPC combination
		- Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it.
		- It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
		- If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue
		- If your application give a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched.
		- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
		- All outbound traffic is authorized by default

- Classic ports to know for inbound/outbound rules ^d7e2d6
	- 22: [SSH](SSH.md) (Secure Shell) - log into a instance via terminal
	- 21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
	- 22: SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files using SSH
	- 80: HTTP - access unsecured websites
	- 442: HTTPs - access secured websites
	- 3389: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - Log into windows instance


### Security groups hands on
- For any EC2 instance, you can see security group details under instance details → Security → Inbound/outbound rules
- To go to Security Groups page, use the following
	- Go to EC2 dashboard
	- In sidebar, under `Network & Security`, there is an option `Security Groups`, click on that
	- There you can find list of security groups
		- By default, there will be one security group
		- and if you have created any EC2 instance, some of the security groups have been created with them if you have created any.
- Security group have following information
	- Security group name
	- Security group ID
	- Description
	- VPC ID
	- Inbound/Outbound rules
		- Rules can be added based on [](.md#^d7e2d6%7Cports) and source
